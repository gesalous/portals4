Shared Memory Unimplemented Features:

- Ptl{LE,ME}Append() does not work with persistent LEs and buffered headers
- Ptl{LE,ME}Append() cannot deliver buffered messages without local data (no
  retransmit protocol yet implemented)
- Truncated Messages for gets and atomics (works for puts)
- PtlPTEnable()
- PtlPTDisable()

Shared Memory Performance Needs:

- Add MPI-like benchmark tests
  + Message latency (hotpotato is nice, but not an exact MPI duplicate)
